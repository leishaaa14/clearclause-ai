# AI Contract Analysis Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan transforms the ClearClause application from a basic fullstack foundation into a sophisticated AI-powered contract analysis system. The plan follows a modular approach, implementing the AI model system first, then the API fallback system, and finally integrating both through a unified interface. Each task builds incrementally to ensure a working system at every stage.
