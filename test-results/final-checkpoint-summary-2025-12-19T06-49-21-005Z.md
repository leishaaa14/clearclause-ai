- **Impact:** Document processing pipeline affected


### Property 22: Error and fallback logging
- **Error:** Expected error logs not generated
- **Impact:** Error handling validation incomplete


### Property 4: Raw Text Processing Consistency
- **Error:** Test timeout after 60 seconds
- **Impact:** Raw text processing performance issues


## System Health Assessment

- **Core Features:** GOOD
- **AWS Integration:** PARTIAL
- **Test Coverage:** COMPREHENSIVE
- **Code Quality:** GOOD

## Recommendations


### Test Failures (Priority: HIGH)
73 tests are currently failing

**Actions:**
- Fix property-based test failures related to document processing
- Resolve PDF buffer handling issues in ContractAnalyzer
- Improve error logging validation in test scenarios
- Address performance issues in raw text processing
- Fix integration test expectations for clause extraction

**Impact:** Critical - Core functionality validation is incomplete


### E2E Integration (Priority: HIGH)
End-to-end testing shows integration issues

**Actions:**
- Complete AWS credential security validation
- Ensure all test phases can execute successfully
- Validate dataset file processing pipeline
- Test real AWS service integration

**Impact:** High - System integration not fully validated


### Property-Based Testing (Priority: MEDIUM)
Property-based tests reveal specification issues

**Actions:**
- Review property test generators for valid input domains
- Fix document processing to handle various input formats correctly
- Improve error handling to match property test expectations
- Optimize performance for property test timeout issues

**Impact:** Medium - Correctness properties not fully validated


### Performance (Priority: MEDIUM)
Performance tests show areas for improvement

**Actions:**
- Optimize contract processing for large documents
- Improve concurrent request handling
- Reduce processing time variability
- Implement better resource management

**Impact:** Medium - System performance could be improved


### Testing Infrastructure (Priority: LOW)
Testing framework and coverage improvements

**Actions:**
- Increase test timeout for long-running property tests
- Improve test data generators for edge cases
- Add more comprehensive error scenario testing
- Enhance test reporting and metrics collection

**Impact:** Low - Testing quality and reliability improvements


## Next Steps


⚠️ **System needs attention before production deployment**

Key areas requiring immediate attention:
1. Fix failing property-based tests
2. Resolve document processing pipeline issues
3. Complete AWS integration validation
4. Address performance bottlenecks

Recommended timeline: 1-2 weeks for critical fixes.
